# WebApiWithNswag

This example shows how NSwag support can easily be added to a Web API project, and how different API versions can be supported. This code is based on the examples provided in the [.Net Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio-code) and [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag/wiki/AspNetCore-Middleware) documentation.

This was developed using Visual Studio Code.

Please note that the Visual Studio Code C# extension may not honour the settings in launchSettings.json. If not, you need to browse to https://localhost:5001/swagger to see the swagger UI.
